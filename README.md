# Applied Robotics

Code developed as I studied at Drexel for my Applied Robotics class.

A collection of Python Code files that implement various algorithms for determine end effector to base frame relationships for a two-arm manipulator. In addition there are some Arduino code files that outline how to get a rough version of the 2-link manipulator working.
